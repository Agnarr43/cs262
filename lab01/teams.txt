1.
I'm a junior BCS major
I'm fairly sure I got As in 112 and 212. 214 was a little rougher last sem with covid online

2.
I have done a tiny tiny amount of javascript, and zero SQL database stuff.
I've used slack once long ago, if it's anything like discord it shouldn't be hard to learn.
I've not used trello, and have limited experience with github.
Whatever project I end up working on, I'd ideally like it to be something that Calvin students
	would actually use and benefit from.

3.
Extroversion - 16
Emotional Stability - 87
Agreeableness - 51
Conscientiousness - 72
Intellect/Imagination - 34

I'm friends with Ryan Vreeke, we'd probably like to work together. We've been
	partners on a couple things in the past programming wise and it
	worked out well. There isn't anybody I wouldn't want to work with.

4.
I'm not the best at coming up with ideas, but if there is one that I like 
	I'll fully jump on board with it and help to make it a reality.
