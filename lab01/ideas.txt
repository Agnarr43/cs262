I liked one of the forum posts about streamlining the new Dorm and KE mail system.
I'm not sure if they use spreadsheets or something to send out emails to people who have mail,
but it's been getting to me at like 10pm I'm sure there is a better way.


Wacky Idea
Some sort of AR mapping rpg game/activity thing sort of like pokemon go type structure.
There could be objectives or locations around campus that could unlock stuff.
