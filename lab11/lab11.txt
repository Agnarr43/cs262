- I deleted the "Alert" import from userTimes.js because it's not being used
- VS Code has a format shortcut, SHIFT+ALT+F, but however it's auto-configured it sucks
    - It split up each import into it's own 3-line long thing
    - It also just made tons of newlines and indents, some of which actually broke the code and syntax rules
- I scanned through some of the other files, checking for unused variables. I made notes of them but didn't delete them because the github merges might get funky
