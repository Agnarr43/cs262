# CS 262 - Lab #02
This lab is based on [this guide](https://cs.calvin.edu/courses/cs/262/kvlinden/02management/lab.html)  

Answers to lab questions:
1. I believe it's all in the functional component App, and inside there are multiple subcomponents, View, Text, TextInput, Button, etc.
2. There are many props, one of them is onChangeText. name is a state, it happens to have the initial value "John Smith"
3. Curly braces can be used to define an object, or for the "value" of the props, like style={styles.container} grabs the styling object for containers
4. There is an anonymous function on line 22 that changes the name to whatever is being typed in. it has no identifier and can't be accessed anywhere else.
5. It doesn't use CSS or HTML, but the javascript and react native emulate the same ideas of CSS.
